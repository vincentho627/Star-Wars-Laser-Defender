# Star-Wars-Laser-Defender

This is a laser defender game I have created as a fun project with a star wars theme in Unity. The game has yet to be completed and has various improvements that can be made. The current version allows players to choose their fighter, get power boosts such as shield, enhanced laser attacks and more. 

The goal of the game is simple, try to reach as many points as possible without dying. The controls for moving are the arrow keys whilst shooting is done with the spacebar.

This game in this version currently has no end, there is a boss battle every level and a teleportation to another galaxy level through hyper space. After each hyperspace, the damage from the enemies start to increase so DON'T GET HIT!

There are many more battles to come and many more enemies to be defeated in the future.

Please comment if you are interested or if you have any suggestions. Thanks!
